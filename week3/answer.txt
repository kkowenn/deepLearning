1   what is the underfitting problem?
    A model with too little capacity cannot learn the problem and
    result in a model that does not generalize well.

2   How to overcome the underfitting problem?
    Increase Model Complexity:
    more hidden layers.
    Add more features:

3   What is the overfitting problem?
    a model with too much capacity can learn it too well and overfit the training dataset.
    Both cases result in a model that does not generalize well.

4   How to prevent or avoid overfitting in neural network?
    Data Augmentation(for image data)
    Dropout

5   What is regularization in neural network?
    Regularization in neural networks is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting
    and improve the generalization ability of the model.

    ▪ The cross-entropy cost function:  is used to measure the performance of a classification
        model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. The formula for binary classification

    ▪ Regularization methods
        ▪ Dropout: ignoring randomly selected neurons during each forward and backward pass,
            dropout forces the network to learn redundant representations.

        ▪ Early stopping: where the training process is halted before the model starts to overfit.
            It monitors the model's performance on a validation set
            and stops training when the performance stops improving.

        ▪ Artificially expanding the training data:
            ▪ Data augmentation: variety of transformations to the existing data: Flipping,
                Rotation, Scaling, Translation, Color Jitter, Noise Injection
