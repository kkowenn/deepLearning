Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that aims to create machines capable of
performing tasks requiring human intelligence,
such as understanding language, recognizing images, solving problems, and making decisions.
Within AI,

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data and improve their performance over
time without explicit programming. ML includes types like supervised learning, where the computer learns from labeled data;
unsupervised learning, where it finds patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where it learns by
receiving rewards or punishments from its environment.

Deep Learning (DL), a subfield of ML, uses neural networks with many layers to automatically discover patterns
from large amounts of raw data, making it especially powerful for processing images, audio, and text.
Tools like TensorFlow and Keras aid in building and training these models.


TensorFlow, developed by Google, is an open-source software library for machine learning and deep learning,
offering flexibility and scalability for various applications,

Keras is a high-level API that simplifies the creation of deep learning models by providing
easy-to-use building blocks and running on top of TensorFlow making it ideal for rapid prototyping
and research.
