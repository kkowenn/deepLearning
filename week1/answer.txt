Differences Between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI):
- AI is a broad field that encompasses any technique
    which enables computers to mimic human intelligence.
- AI can include rule-based systems, decision trees
    and other techniques that do not necessarily involve learning from data.

Machine Learning (ML):
- ML is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms
    and statistical models to enable computers to perform tasks
    without explicit instructions, relying instead on patterns and inference.
- ML focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make predictions on data.

- Examples include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

Deep Learning (DL):
- DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep networks)
    to model complex patterns in data.
- DL involves algorithms called neural networks,
    which are designed to simulate the way the human brain operates.

- Examples include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence data.

Summary Note:
AI: Broad field aiming to create machines that mimic human intelligence.
ML: Subfield of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data.
DL: Subfield of ML utilizing deep neural networks for complex data modeling.



TensorFlow and Keras

TensorFlow:
- TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
- It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for developing, training,
    and deploying ML models.
- TensorFlow supports a wide range of tasks, including deep learning,
    and can run on various hardware platforms such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
- It is highly flexible and can be used for both research and production purposes.

Keras:
- Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python
    that runs on top of TensorFlow.
- It provides a high-level API that makes it easy to build
    and train deep learning models.
- Keras simplifies the process of designing neural networks,
    offering user-friendly functions for constructing layers,
    loss functions, optimizers, and more.
- Initially developed as a standalone library,
    Keras has been integrated into TensorFlow,
    making it the recommended high-level API for building models in TensorFlow.
